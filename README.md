## About the project
I created this project to practice using django to construct the backend of a website,meanwhile I used some jquery too.But I didn't put css in the project.So the design doesn't look so pleasant.
## Project details
If you want to get this django project on a linux server and get it online,notice that some settings need to be done,and the file "gen_vercode.py" need to be modified.
Also, I deleted the settins.py in golab for security reasons.
